My name is Greg Walters and I am a programmer, an author, amature photographer and a pretty darn good cook. This repository has been set up to support my writing.  I've been writing articles for [Full Circle Magazine](https://fullcirclemagazine.org/) since issue #27 back in July 2009. The current (at this writing) is issue #133 (May 2018). My articles are on Python programming and programming in the REAL world using Python.

I am currently working on my second book tenatively titled *"Learning Page - A Python GUI Designer"*. Page, as the title suggests is a free Graphical User Interface Designer for Python using the Tkinter Toolkit. Page has been around many years and is currently at version 4.13.

You can find Page [HERE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/) at https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/

Eventually, I plan to providing an index to all of my Full Circle Magazine articles as well as a link to the code for each article. That will take a while, though. In addition, I plan to provide tips and code for using Python, Page and other things. I will probably slip in a photograph or 12 that I've taken over the years as well as mental musings that I find interesting (that most of you probably won't...but hey, this is my site, right?).

This site is in flux, so come back often and see what I've done to it.
