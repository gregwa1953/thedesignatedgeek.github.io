Yes, it's been a while since I have had a chance to post anything here (actually not much of anything to say worth putting up here).

As to Page, there have been many things that are happening with Page.  I've been working with Don on improvements to Page and he released version 4.17 on September 17, 2018.  The next day, he started working on version 4.18.  Lots of changes have gone into page since my last post about version 4.14.  He's added so many things that I can't really remember them all, however, here is a list directly from his help file.

* The 4.17 release displays the locked state of a widget in the Attribute Editor, adds a preference for setting the indentation, expands tabs when updating the support module, fixes a subtle bug with placement within labelframe widgets, and enhances the use of geometric attributes in the Attribute Editor.

* The 4.16 release fixes an important bug in the support module update feature as well as improving the “Fill Container” function.

* The 4.15 release improves the use of the Binding Window, improves the display of callback functions, and the automatic saving of the project file. The ttk::separator widget is added and support of custom widgets expanded. Individual widget geometries can now be locked to prevent mouse changes.

I'm still working with the gang at Full Circle Magazine and have an article due very soon for the October issue.

I've also been answering questions from Page users on issues that they are having and have been more "visible" on the Page discussion forum.

My health has been up and down, but I have a new doctor here now and he's great.  He's working hard to get this old body and brain to work together well so I can continue to move forword.

That's it in a nutshell, but I hope I can start updating at least once a week soon.  Until my next brain dump, have a great time.
