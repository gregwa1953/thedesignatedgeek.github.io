According to my file repository, it's been almost 1 1/2 years since I last did anything with this website.  I KNEW it had been a while, but I didn't realize just how long it had been.

***I APOLOGIZE!***

I can tell you, that my health has been the biggest cause of my absence.  It is very difficult trying to sit for anything more than about 30 minutes to an hour (if at all).  Trying to do anything that anyone would consider "normal" is difficult at best.  I am able to do some very simple things most of the time, like dressing or making dinner, but even those little things end up taking all my energy and I have to revert to the bed or the couch for hours at a time.  I have been able to keep up with my articles for Full Circle.  I'm currently working on article #108 for FCM 160 due out at the end of August.

I've been doing a large amount of work for Packt, a book publisher in India and the rest of the world, as both author and what they call "Technical Reviewer".  I've currently done 8 books as Technical Reviewer and one that I co-authored for them.  The name of the book is Hands-On Generative Adversarial Networks with PyTorch 1.x and you can pick it up at [https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-generative-adversarial-networks-with-pytorch-1-0]( https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-generative-adversarial-networks-with-pytorch-1-0) or at Amazon.com ([https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-PyTorch-ebook/dp/B0822HBYXS/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2HU5UG1BDQYP0&dchild=1&keywords=hands-on+generative+adversarial+networks+with+pytorch+1.x&qid=1596494308&sprefix=hands+on+Generative+Ad%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-PyTorch-ebook/dp/B0822HBYXS/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2HU5UG1BDQYP0&dchild=1&keywords=hands-on+generative+adversarial+networks+with+pytorch+1.x&qid=1596494308&sprefix=hands+on+Generative+Ad%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-2)) and is currently rated #111 in Human-Computer Interaction (Kindle Store), #75 in Machine Theory (Kindle Store) and #74 in Neural Networks.

On the topic of the PAGE book, I have been contacted by a publisher asking if I would be interested in writing another book.  I pulled out the last version of the outline, dusted it up and changed a number of things, deleting some ideas and adding others.  At this point, I'm shooting at 11 "meaty" chapters, one summary chapter, and one chapter acting as a combined introduction and installation guide.  There will be at least 14 programs presented in the book.  All of this is subject to change, of course, and the publisher hasn't given me their take on my proposal yet.  If I get an acceptance letter or a rejection slip, I will post it here and keep plugging away, even if it is only 1 1/2 hour a day.

Just so you know (and in my life, If I put it out to the universe, I WILL make it happen some how), I am planning on trying to do at least 2 posts per month for the foreseeable future.

There's a lot more that I want to talk about, but since I've just promised that I will do 2 posts a month, I guess I'll save something for next time.



Until then, stay safe, healthy, positive and creative!
