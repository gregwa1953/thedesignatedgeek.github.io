Years ago, when I programmed in Visual Basic, I found that I occasionally needed some separators, just a series of 2 pixel lines, to break up the information on the form.  I didn't need a full frame to do this.  I started off using a 2 pixel light line, but visually that wasn't pleasing enough.  Then one day I was fooling around and found that if I used a frame the width that I wanted, but only set the height at 2, that I had something that looked like it was done using a control (what we called widgets back in those days).  When anyone saw my layouts, they would as me how I did it.

Now, I use Page to create my Python forms and found myself needing a horizontal separator again.  I know that the Tkinter ttk toolbox provides a separator widget, but much to my dismay, Page didn't support the separators. Then I remembered my trick from way back when. I tried using a frame widget, but it didn't work. A flash of inspiration hit me and I tried a standard label with the relief set to 'raised' and a height of 2 pixels. It worked just the way I remembered.

As you can see, not only can you do horizontal separators, you can also do vertical ones and _**as an added bonus**_, you can place the end of your horizontal separator on top of the vertical one.

So, the steps are simple.
- Add a label widget to your layout in the Page designer.
- Drag the label widget edge to the width (or height for vertical) you want it to be
- Using the Attribute Editor, set the relief to 'raised'
- Set the alias to something like **'lblSep1'** (optional)
- Set the height (or width for vertical) to 2.

That's it. 

When you look at your _project_.py file generated by Page, you can see:
```python
    self.lblSep2 = Label(top)
    self.lblSep2.place(relx=0.12, rely=0.3, height=2, width=506)
    self.lblSep2.configure(relief=RAISED)
    self.lblSep2.configure(text='''Label''')
    self.lblSep2.configure(width=506)
```

Now you have a visual separator, with NO code, just a couple of attribute changes.

Have a great day!
