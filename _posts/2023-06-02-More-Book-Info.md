# Even more updates on the Book and MicroPython stuff

Well, first about the book.  As of 3am CDT this morning, Amazon was reporting the following stats to my latest book...

### Best Sellers Rank: \#461,869 in Books (See Top 100 in Books)

### \#104 in Software Design Tools

### \#287 in Computer Programming Languages

### #505 in Python Programming

I think that's pretty darn good for a book that's been available for less than a week.

## MicroPython Update...

The I2C issue seems to be fairly working as long as you stick to the new default pins.  For I2C(0), use GPIO 4 for SDA and GPIO 5 for SCL.

For I2C(1), use GPIO 6 for SDA and GPIO 7 for SCL

This is supposedly was a request from the RPi foundation.

## Motor and PWM

Yes, by adding the freq to the pin definitions or shortly after that, things should work correctly and as before.

## BLE

No information has changed as far as I can tell.

## Other Random Things...

I've been thinking about reworking the website here.  It served (and still is serving) it's purpose, but I think it's about time to give it a face lift.
There is not time frame as to when this might happen.

### PAGE 8.0

Don is working VERY hard on updating PAGE from 7.6 to 8.0.  I'm working equally hard to break it as quickly as he brings out fixes.  It **IS** coming, but right now I can't tell you just how soon.  It will have some FANTASTIC updates.  

Until next time, be safe.
