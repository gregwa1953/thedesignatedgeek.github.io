# Hello again, fellow Beings!
## Happy New Year.

2024 is upon us, not sneaking up behind us, but coming like a locomotive.  The time that's left for 2023 is quickly ending and I must say, I will be happy to see the back of it.  Not that 2023 has been all that bad, but it could have been much better and with a bit of luck and grace from the *"Cosmic Muffin"*, 2024 will be much better for all of us.

Just like 2024, **PAGE 8.0** is also coming upon us like a locomotive.  I'm not exactly positive of the actual date, but it is close my friends.  And when it comes, I'm certain that you will very happy.  So many great changes will bring a much better and useful PAGE.

I've been busy working with Don on all the changes to **PAGE** and using **PAGE** to create many tools for myself, to keep me more productive and entertained.  I keep coming up with more tools and utilities, some I will be sharing and some I will be keeping for myself.
PAGE
I have taken a position an online Python tutor for **Findtutors.co.uk** even though I live in the United States.  I'm excited about this and hope that I will be able to help even more Programmers.  I'll keep you advised.

Enough for now.  Once **PAGE 8.0** hits, I'll be posting some tutorials and code with you.

So here's to **2024**!

Until then, be safe and continue to be creative!!!!!!!!!!!!

Greg
