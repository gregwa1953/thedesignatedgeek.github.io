# BEEN TOO LONG!

I'm REALLY sorry that it's been 6 months (give or take) since my last update.  I've been SO busy and then my machine decided to go belly up.  Luckily I was able to recover most everything onto a new drive, but I'm still not 100% yet.  Soon maybe.

### PAGE 8.0

Don and I have working VERY hard on getting 8.0 ready for release.  I've created a 'Using PAGE 8.x' document that should help anyone who has ever used PAGE before and even those who never have.  It's not intended to replace the 'Learning Page' document, just bring everybody up to speed.

With any luck, we MIGHT be able to release shortly after the New Year.

## Happy Holidays to you and yours!

Until next time, be safe.

Greg
