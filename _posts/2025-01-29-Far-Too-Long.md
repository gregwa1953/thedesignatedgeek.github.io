# Just a simple update

I've been busy with PAGE work with Don, handling user support, coming up with demos and simply trying to handle life at home with my adult son. Also I've been trying and coming up with new recipes.

I've also been trying to learn the art of Pellet Smoker cooking and smoking cheese.

YES, smoking cheese. Not the kind of smoking like a cigarette or cigar, but the smoked cheese that you eat. Smoking cheese is pretty hard to do in Texas, since you have to have around 4 1/2 hours of temperatures less than 70 degrees and very little sun, since the sun heats the smoker (which you **DON'T** want to get hot) which will cause the cheese to get icky!

I've also taken on a personal quest. To bring BWidgets (something from Tcl/Tk) into the world of Tkinter and Python. One would think that would be pretty easy, but believe me, it's not.

I'm also challenged by trying to migrate everything from Linux Mint 21.3 to 22.1. Some of the things were simple. Most, not so much!



### PAGE 8.1

Don and I have been working VERY hard on updating PAGE 8.1.  As usual, most of my time is spent breaking each and every update and release candidate as fast as Don can create another one.  It **IS** coming, but right now I can't tell you just how soon.  There only a couple of big changes in 8.1...

- Menubuttons (both Tk and ttk)
- Completely reworked (from scratch) the **ENTIRE** menu system.

There are multiple small (not minor) issue fixes from 8.0 (and earlier) and many of the things that have been sticking in all of our craws now are history.

So, that the update for now. With any luck, I'll be able to start posting here more often.

Until next time, be safe.

Greg
