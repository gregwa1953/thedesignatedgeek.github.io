Today Don Rozenberg released version 4.14 of Page a GUI designer for Python.

I've been using Page for many years and Don has done a great job of maintaining and adding new features.

Version 4.14 "provides function to save the Widget Tree to a file and function to display callback functions. Fixes are also made for copy and paste as well as to relative placement."

I'm looking forward to testing and trying version 4.14 and sharing my thoughts with you.
