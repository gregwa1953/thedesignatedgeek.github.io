Good morning,

I have to say that this is not what I was planning to write about today.   I had settled on a rant and rave type of post, but instead was greeted with an email from the prospective publisher on the PAGE book.

To say that I was surprised is an understatement.  I had expected that the committee examination/dissection/picky-picky comment process would take until the weekend to get back to me.  (Yes, I have done this before)  But, to my delight, the response was basically "Hey Greg.  We got your proposal and we have some suggestions that would make it better.  Give it a look and get back to us."  I had not even gotten through half of my first cup of coffee!

I opened the document with a bit of dread and expectations of hack and slash suggestions.  Again, I was surprised that there were only two suggestions.  Both were realistic, good and were helpful.

I made the changes requested with a bit of Greg's own spin on things.  I'm waiting to hear back as I type this.  Ahhhh, the joys of working with people on the other side of the planet.  I'm guessing that the prospective publisher's offices are about 11 hours ahead of me.  I have a real problem trying to remember that others are living and working in a different part of the world where, when I'm awake and "working", they are trying to be snug in their beds and getting the much needed rest that they so rightly deserve.

I don't understand WHY my brain refuses to take this at face value.  I've been working with the Full Circle Group for well over 10 years.  Ronnie, the editor, lives and works in Scotland.  He is around 6 hours ahead of me.  My friend in Norway, Halvard, is about 7 hours ahead of me.  Logically, I know this.  Intellectually, I know this.  But for some reason, it doesn't sink into my brain that when I send or respond to an email from others, they are many times, not within a 3 hour time zone offset from me.  

I have to attribute it to the fact that when I started working, we didn't have email.  We didn't have the Internet.  Heck, we didn't have computers, colour TV, microwave ovens or cell phones that have more computing power than the space craft that sent men to the moon.



ANYWAY, enough spewing of the random firings of the neurons in my ancient brain.  The bottom line, is that there IS progress on the book and it is, so far, positive.  



*Greg*
