As promised, here is the latest information on the book and some other things.

As of Wednesday August 5, I have signed the contract for a book entitled **"Learning Page A GUI Designer For Python"**.  At this point, I am expecting it to have 13 chapters and to be a little over 300 pages.  The publisher seems to be very excited about the project, as am I.  I am shooting for a date of early January 2021 for publication.

I just got through writing the base article for the August issue of **FCM**.  I've got to go back through and do some sanity checks.  As I was writing it, my back was screaming and had to take copious amounts of pain meds just to be able to sit for a short while to work on it.  It seemed to me to be very disjointed thought wise and I am not happy with the text in general, so most of today will be spent reworking it, so it doesn't rot the brains of anyone who attempts to read it.  The code works well and I will be providing the code, not on pastebin.com as normal, but on a github repository.  This is due to the need to include images for the project.  Once I get the text in reasonable shape, I think it will be fine.

I needed to update my system to a dual monitor arrangement on Friday.  This is something that I've wanted to do for a while, but I had to bite the bullet and do it to support a user of PAGE.  I had never thought that it would be an issue, and for the most part, it was a simple workaround.  I'll be writing up a post in a few days showing some of the benefits and gotchas.

With any luck, I will be modifying my rig to be able to triple boot between Linux Mint 20, Ubuntu 20 and Windows 10 on Sunday.  Again, it's something that I've wanted to do for a while, but life and work keeps getting in the way.

That's all for right now.  Hopefully, I will be able to get another post or two next week.  Be sure to check back every now and then.

Until then; stay safe, healthy, positive and creative!
