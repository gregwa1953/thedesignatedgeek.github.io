Greeting fellow beings!

I've spent a lot of time creating a number of utilities lately and testing the latest development version of **PAGE**.  Our lifestyle has changed at home, which makes things really difficult to concentrate on anything, but so far, I'm able to keep things on track.  


To those who are interested in my writing, I'm working on two books in my spare time.  One on *Advanced GUI Programming using PAGE* and one on *Understanding and Creating Themes in Python and Tcl*.  I'm really excited about these two books and will basically be self publishing them.  I've found a site that looks like it might be right for selling the books for me.  We'll see what comes of it.  I'm trying to get both books to around 300-450 pages long to keep other publishing options open.  I'll keep you updated as time goes on.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all.  May your 2024 be your best year ever!


That's it for today, as always, until next time, be safe and stay creative!!!!!


Greg
