[Full Circle Magazine](https://fullcirclemagazine.org/) is a free, independent, monthly PDF magazine dedicated to the Ubuntu family of Linux operating systems. Each month, it contains helpful how-to articles and reader submitted stories. 

As of May 26, 2018 there are 133 issues of Full Circle Magazine all available for download as PDF files and many as epub format files as well.

The kind folks at FCM have also created a series of special editions of reprints of the Python series written by me that includes Parts 1-60 from FCM#27 through FCM#102 in a single PDF at (http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issuePC01_en.pdf). These were the "Beginning Programming in Python" series.

Other files in the Python Special editions can be found at (https://fullcirclemagazine.org/python-special-editions/). 

Parts 1 through 10 includes the same content as the first link but in separate PDF files as well as parts 60-66 and 67-72 in volumes 11 and 12 which covers most of the Python in the REAL world series.  For parts 73 to current, you can download the single FCM issues from (https://fullcirclemagazine.org/downloads/)
