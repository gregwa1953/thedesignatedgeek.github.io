  <h2 class="alt">Welcome to <strong>TheDesignatedGeek</strong> web site, a place where you can find information about<br />
  my current projects, books, articles in Full Circle Magazine and more.</h2><br><br>
  <i><strong>Please see below for an update.</strong><br><br>
  My site is currently using the Prologue Jekyll Theme which is free.<br>
  <p>You can find more on the Prologue theme at Chris Bobbe's site on <a href="https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue">GitHub!</a></p>

  I'm still in the process of creating this site, so you might want to visit often so see what changes I end up making. This also means that there might be somethings that are broken here and there.  If you see something that doesn't work correctly, please use the contact section below and let me know.

      <i><strong>Update Sunday 30 April, 2023 -<br>
        <br>
        I'm SO sorry that it's been so long since I've updated this site.&nbsp;
        The reasons are fairly normal for anyone.&nbsp; Health problems,
        Covid-19, Life, too much to do, etc.&nbsp; I know everyone has heard
        this before.<br>
        <br>
        I still am writing for Full Circle Magazine, I'm still trying to work on
        my book on PAGE (currently with the publisher for editing).&nbsp; I'm still working with
        Don Rozenberg on new versions of PAGE and trying to support it.&nbsp;
        Needless to say, I am keeping busy, but my body keeps being
        uncooperative so it's difficult.<br>
        <br>
        I will try to do at least monthly updates from here on out, even if it
        is to simply say, that I'm still here.<br>
        <br></strong>
        Greg</i>
