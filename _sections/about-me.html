<p>My name is Greg Walters and I have been a programmer since 1972.  I am currently retired and living
    in Central Texas, USA.  I currently write (somewhat due to medical problems) monthly articles for <br>
    <a href="https://fullcirclemagazine.org">Full Circle Magazine</a>
    and have since issue #27 back in July 2009. <br> 
    My latest article can be found in issue #133 (May 2018). <br><br>
    I am also an author, amature photographer, fair musician and a pretty darn good cook.<br>
    I ocassionally do custom tutorials for various people and projects, the latest of which <br>
    is for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/">Page</a> which is a free GUI designer for Python. <br>
    My tutorial can be found in the /docs folder of the latest Page release. <br><br>
    I am currently writing a book on using Page which will hopefully be published in <br>
    late 2018 or 2019. At this point, I'm planning on it having between 10 and 15 chapters<br>
    and being about 450 pages long.
