## Page

I've written about Page a number of times over the years (since 2012 actually), and I love it. Page is a Drag-and-drop GUI (Grapical User Interface) designer for Python using Tkinter that is written by Don Rozenberg. Page creates Python files Page has been around many years and is currently at version 4.13. It features Graphical menus, notebook widgets and panedwindow widgets. It supports most Tk and many ttk widgets and is very easy to use. Don has written a large number of examples and some very good documentation for Page.
